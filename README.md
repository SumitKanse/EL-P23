Create a REST API to Manage a List of Books Using Node.js and Express.
README: Book List Project 
This project is a simple web app that manages a list of books. It has two parts that work together:

Back-End (Server)
The back-end is built with Node.js and Express.js. It's the "brain" of the app. It stores the book list and follows a set of rules (an API) for how to add, change, and delete books.

Front-End (Website)
The front-end is what you see in your web browser. It's built with React and is the "face" of the app. It talks to the back-end to show the book list and send commands (like "add a new book") when you click buttons.

How it Works 
The front-end and back-end communicate to build the full app.

When you write the code in a tool like VS Code, the editor often helps with autosuggestions. This makes it easy to type things like app.get() or express, and saves you from having to remember every command!

How to Run 
Back-End: In your server folder, run npm install express, then start the server with node server.js.

Front-End: Start your React app, and it will automatically connect to the server.
